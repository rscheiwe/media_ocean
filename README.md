# Media Ocean

Media Ocean is where Twitter meets IMDB. Users log in, find movies they wish to watch or ones that they have watched, and submit reviews for other users to read. A feed is always available for each user to stay up-to-date on their friends' reviews and postings. A full-scale search engine allows for users and site visitors to access all 300K+ movies and shows through the TMDB/IMDB API.

## Getting Started

Media Ocean is built with a Ruby on Rails backend and plain `.erb` frontend.
